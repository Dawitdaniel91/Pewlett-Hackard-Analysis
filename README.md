# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# 1. Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the project is to determine the number of retiring employees and eligible to participate in the mentorship program. The results are based on the employees of Pewlett-Hackard born between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955. The analysis is by creating a query from the data employee table and table by retrieving the title, from date and to date column, and title table. Join both tables by selecting the primary keys(empo_no), filtering the data by birth date, and putting the information in the new table.in delivery on created the unique title by using the DISTINCT ON function and used the order by count function to show the total number by each title. The second delivery query retrieved column from employee and demp_emp table, filter the data of the current employee and the department table, filter the data by current employee born in 1965 then order the table by empo_no.
